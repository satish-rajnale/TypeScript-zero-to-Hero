 Typescript all use cases and definations that I learn

Typescript as the name suggests adds types to your code. 
For example : javascript is not a type defined language but by using typescript we can make js code also type defined.

Typescript is not only limited to javascript. You can use it with language or framework to make your code more robust and bug free.
Typescript aims at providing long term gain for small constribution in type defining your code.
